`passmaker` is a cli password maker in Rust.

## Why did I make it?

Primarily, to learn Rust and get some experience with it.
A couple of years ago I switched over to using password managers to store and sync my passwords. So, insted of creating
my own passwords, I was using the password generators in Chrome or Bitwarden. The chrome password generator is not
configurable, but the bitwarden one is, but unlocking my vault every time I wanted to create a new password was getting
cumbersome. Hence, `passmaker`.
